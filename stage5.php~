When a father who               has hemophilia and a mother who is a carrier create a child there               are four possible outcomes for each pregnancy. This depends on which               X or Y chromosome the children receive from the father and which               of the two X chromosomes the children receive from the mother. As               illustrated above they can have a son without hemophilia, a daughter               who has hemophilia, a son with hemophilia or a daughter who is a               carrier. With each pregnancy there is an equal chance of each of               these outcomes.
