          <p align="Left">Hemophilia is carried on the X chromosome. It is called an X linked genetic disorder. A women who is a carrier for hemophilia has the genetic mutation on one of her X chromosomes as illustrated above. She will have another non mutated X chromosome that will usually somewhat compensate for the defect in the other. It is not uncommon for women who carry the hemophilia gene to have low levels of clotting factor and have bleeding problems. A man who has hemophilia has the genetic mutation on his only X chromosome. He does not have another X chromosome to compensate for the defect so he will have hemophilia. 2/3rds of the cases of hemophilia are inherited. The other 1/3 occur with no family history and are called spontaneous genetic mutations. The spontaneous genetic mutation may either occur in a female fetus or a male fetus. The female fetus will become a carrier of hemophilia. The male fetus will become a person affected by hemophilia.
